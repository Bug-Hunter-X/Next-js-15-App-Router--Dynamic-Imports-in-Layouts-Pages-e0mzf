# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Imports in Layouts/Pages

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's App Router related to dynamic imports within layout or page components.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior, such as rendering failures or runtime errors when dynamic imports fail to resolve properly.  This might happen due to issues with path resolution or other unforeseen interactions within the App Router's architecture.

## Bug Description:

Dynamic imports (`import()` statements) within layout or page components sometimes fail to load correctly, leading to rendering issues. The application might render incompletely, or throw runtime errors. This is particularly noticeable when dealing with code-splitting and loading components on demand.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the rendering behavior.  The expected behavior is a simple 'Hello, world!' message; however, due to the bug, you might observe an error or an incomplete render.

## Solution:

The solution demonstrates a potential workaround.  However, it is advised to closely monitor updates in the Next.js releases to determine if a more robust official fix is released.   Workarounds often depend on the specific source of the failure, such as ensuring proper path resolution within dynamic imports and carefully managing dependency loading.
